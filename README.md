# Snakes and Ladders Game

This project implements a **Snakes and Ladders** game in Java. Players roll dice to move across the board, encountering snakes and ladders that affect their progress. The goal is to reach the last position on the board before other players.

## Features
- **Dynamic Game Setup:** The game board size, number of players, and number of dice are configurable by the user.
- **Random Dice Rolls:** Each player rolls dice to determine how far they will move. The dice can be configured to roll multiple dice at once.
- **Snakes and Ladders:** The game includes various snakes and ladders, which move players backward (snake) or forward (ladder) on the board.
- **Game Flow:** Players take turns rolling dice, moving on the board, and interacting with snakes or ladders. The first player to reach the last position on the board wins.
- **Player Tracking:** Players are tracked by their names and positions on the board.

## Classes Overview
1. **Mover (Abstract class)**: A base class for all game movers (snakes and ladders). Each mover has a start and end position.
2. **Snake (Subclass of Mover)**: Represents a snake that moves a player back to a lower position.
3. **Ladder (Subclass of Mover)**: Represents a ladder that moves a player up to a higher position.
4. **Player**: Represents each player with a name, ID, and current position on the board.
5. **Dice**: Handles the rolling of dice and returns the total rolled.
6. **Board**: Represents the game board, stores snakes and ladders, and determines final positions based on player moves.
7. **Game**: The core game class that manages the game state, players, turns, and checks for winners.

## How to Play

1. The user is prompted to input the following details:
   - Size of the board (e.g., 100)
   - Number of players
   - Names of the players
   - Number of dice to roll

2. The game begins with each player rolling the dice and moving based on the roll. Players encounter snakes or ladders that either decrease or increase their position on the board.

3. The game continues until a player reaches the final position on the board. The first player to do so wins the game.
